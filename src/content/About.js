        <h1>More about FAF</h1>
        
        <p>FAF's objective is to help existing and new archers find field archery venues, clubs and their ranges, and be able to submit reviews about the club/an event they attend.</p>

        <p>Inspiration  for the site came in two waves. The first stems from being new to archery and wanting to find information about a club/shoot venue and then be able to find course on the day of the competition (courses set on woodland can be notoriously difficult to find). The second, a 'shoot review', is about having the ability to share ones own experience of a shoot with the host club, other competitors and anyone  interested in archery generally.</p>
